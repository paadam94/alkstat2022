# run
To use the run script, the repo should be placed in a directory in the root of tesztelek2.

get.sh should create the desired ios for given input (merging problems/<problem>/io/*.in and *.out into one file)

# test.sh
own tester, comparing result with the desired one

# testing/
some programs to help finding what's going wrong

# peekio.sh
